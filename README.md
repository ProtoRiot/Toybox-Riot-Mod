**Step-by-Step Exploration of Modding the Toybox 3D Printer**

---

## **Introduction**

Welcome to the **Toybox-Riot-Mod** project. This repository is a space where we document each step of exploring potential modifications for the Toybox 3D printer. Whether it’s experimenting with firmware changes, testing mechanical mods, or simply trying out new ideas, everything is documented here as we go.

This project combines hands-on 3D printing experience with AI-assisted programming to overcome challenges and bring creative ideas to life. We’re not making promises—just sharing our journey as it unfolds.

## **Disclaimer**

**This project is intended for experienced users or those who are eager to move beyond the Toybox's "food or ink" approach and dive into real 3D printing and modding.** Modifying your printer may void warranties, and it carries risks that could potentially damage your hardware. Proceed with caution, and only attempt these modifications if you’re comfortable with the possibility of troubleshooting and problem-solving on your own. This is not a beginner's guide—it's a journey into advanced 3D printing and customization.

## **Current Focus**

We are currently in the early stages of exploring:

- **Understanding the Toybox’s limitations:** Identifying what can be improved or modified.
- **Firmware Exploration:** Looking into options like Klipper to potentially replace the proprietary firmware.
- **Mechanical Modifications:** Experimenting with small tweaks and seeing how they affect performance.

## **Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**

To follow along with our journey, you may want:

- **Basic Tools:** Screwdrivers, pliers, and other small tools for disassembly and reassembly.
- **Software:** Access to CAD software (e.g., Fusion 360) and 3D printing software.
- **3D Printer Filament:** Ensure you have the appropriate filament for any tests.

### **Clone the Repository**

Start by cloning this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ProtoRiot/Toybox-Riot-Mod.git
```

### **Step-by-Step Updates**

As we make progress, we’ll update the repository with our findings, instructions, and any new ideas that emerge. Check back often to see what’s new!
