**Step-by-Step Exploration of Modding the Toybox Alpha V1 3D Printer**

---

## **Introduction**

Welcome to the **Toybox-Riot-Mod** project. This repository is dedicated to documenting the step-by-step exploration of potential modifications for the Toybox Alpha V2 3D printer. While this project focuses specifically on the V1 electronics—featuring an ESP12 controller and an STM32F103—it’s important to note that the V1 and V2 versions of the Toybox Alpha are mechanically the same. This means that most, if not all, mods should be compatible with both versions.

This project combines hands-on 3D printing experience with AI-assisted programming to overcome challenges and bring creative ideas to life. We’re not making promises—just sharing our journey as it unfolds.

## **Disclaimer**

**This project is intended for experienced users or those who are eager to move beyond the Toybox's "food or ink" approach and dive into real 3D printing and modding.** Modifying your printer may void warranties, and it carries risks that could potentially damage your hardware. Proceed with caution, and only attempt these modifications if you’re comfortable with the possibility of troubleshooting and problem-solving on your own. This is not a beginner's guide—it's a journey into advanced 3D printing and customization.

## **Current Focus**

We are currently in the early stages of exploring:

- **Understanding the Toybox Alpha V2’s limitations:** Identifying what can be improved or modified in the V2 version, which has different electronics compared to V1.
- **Firmware Exploration:** Investigating options for replacing the V2 firmware with alternatives like Klipper, focusing on the ESP12 controller and STM32F103.
- **Mechanical Modifications:** Experimenting with small tweaks and seeing how they affect performance. Since the V1 and V2 are mechanically the same, these mods should be applicable to both versions.

## **Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**

To follow along with our journey, you may want:

- **Basic Tools:** Screwdrivers, pliers, and other small tools for disassembly and reassembly.
- **Software:** Access to CAD software (e.g., Fusion 360) and 3D printing software.
- **3D Printer Filament:** Ensure you have the appropriate filament for any tests.

### **Clone the Repository**

Start by cloning this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ProtoRiot/Toybox-Riot-Mod.git
```

### **Step-by-Step Updates**

As we make progress, we’ll update the repository with our findings, instructions, and any new ideas that emerge. Check back often to see what’s new!

## **Usage**

### **Current Exploration**

- **Testing Firmware:** We’re currently experimenting with alternative firmware for the V2 version. Details will be provided as we gather results.
- **Mechanical Tweaks:** Small adjustments are being tested to see their impact on print quality and speed. These tweaks should work for both the V1 and V2 models.
